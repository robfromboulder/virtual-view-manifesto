## 👥 Target Audience

- **Primary**: Trino users (full-stack engineers, application architects, big-data practitioners)
- **Secondary**: Everyone else interested in SQL view patterns
- **Assumptions**: Familiar with SQL views but may not have thought about them architecturally
- **Needs**: Practical guidance, not academic theory
- **Appreciation**: Technical detail and concrete examples
- **Focus**: Keep content optimized for Trino users first

---

## ✍️ Tone and Voice Requirements

### Voice Characteristics
- **Strongly opinionated but not fundamentalist**
- **Plain language and simple sentence construction**
- Use Rob's natural speaking voice (casual, practical, not overly formal)
- "Manifesto" is tongue-in-cheek to attract attention to typically boring database topic
- **Avoid "I" and "we" language**; use third-person objective
- Think **Douglas Adams meets database architecture**
- **Clean and precise as a manifesto** - humor is welcome but shouldn't distract or add complexity
- **Humor and emojis**: Use sparingly, only when payoff is obvious

### Rob's Natural Speaking Patterns
Examples from transcription:
- "This ends up being really, really useful"
- "That's kind of the theory"
- "Let me give you a very concrete set of examples"
- "This is a yawner, right?"
- "That's pretty cool"
- Occasional emoji in written form (but don't overuse)
- Technical but accessible
- Acknowledges simplifications ("admittedly a simplification")

### Editorial Standards
- Be honest about limitations
- Openly recognize constraints and other potential points of view
- Pragmatic over dogmatic
- When in doubt: simpler is better
- **Never use em dashes (—)**: They cause formatting issues with web content and signal AI-generated text to readers. Use commas instead, extending sentences naturally without colons or dashes as breaks

## 📝 Word Choice Guidelines

Preferred terminology (and why):

| Use | Instead of | Reason |
|-----|-----------|--------|
| Virtual views | Logical views | Emphasizes detachment from physical |
| Layer | Level | Implies responsibility, not just hierarchy |
| Swappable | Replaceable | Implies designed for it |
| Application catalog | Feature catalog | Either works, depends on context |
| Federation | Data virtualization | More concrete |

---

## 📋 Success Criteria

The manifesto is successful if readers:

1. ✅ Understand virtual views as architectural pattern, not just database feature
2. ✅ Can implement basic prototyping → production progression
3. ✅ Know when to use (and not use) the pattern
4. ✅ Can plan Iceberg migration using virtual views
5. ✅ Understand the eight principles and why they matter
6. ✅ Have links to ViewMapper and ViewZoo for implementation

## 🔄 Revision Workflow

### When Making Content Changes

1. **Check prose consistency and flow**
2. **Ensure examples are clear and compelling**
3. **Verify Mermaid diagrams render correctly** (use GitHub preview)
4. **Check that all cross-references work** (anchors, links, section references)
5. **Verify tone consistency** (technical but accessible, opinionated but pragmatic)
6. **Update version metadata** at bottom of README:
   - Bump version number (e.g., 0.1 → 0.2 for minor, 1.0 for major)
   - Update "Last Updated" date

### When Making Major Changes

**IMPORTANT**: When making substantial revisions to the manifesto structure, voice, or strategy:

1. **Update this CLAUDE.md file** to reflect new patterns or preferences
2. **Document new section structures** in the "Document Structure Quick Reference"
3. **Add new terminology** to word choice guidelines if needed
4. **Update success criteria** if goals change
5. **Update line numbers** when new content has been reviewed and is ready to commit
6. **Commit CLAUDE.md changes** alongside README changes

This ensures future Claude sessions have the most current context.

## 🎨 Formatting Guidelines

### GitHub Rendering
- Standard GitHub-flavored Markdown
- Mermaid diagrams for visualizations
- Code samples throughout (always use proper language tags)
- No need to mention installation/configuration details (covered by linked projects)

### Code Blocks
- Always specify language: ```sql, ```python, ```bash, etc.
- Keep examples realistic but concise
- Include both simple and realistic examples for major points
- Use comments sparingly (code should be self-evident)

### Mermaid Diagrams
- Use flowcharts for architecture and dependencies
- Use Gantt charts for timeline progressions
- **Use black-and-white only** - No custom colors or fills for readability in both light and dark modes
- Test rendering in GitHub preview

## 🔍 Content Guidelines

### Scope and Emphasis
1. **Scope**: Concepts apply to any database, but Trino is reference implementation due to federation capabilities
2. **Audience assumptions**: Brief primer on classical views included for contrast
3. **Dogmatism level**: Strongly opinionated but pragmatic
4. **Example complexity**: Both simple and realistic for each major point
5. **Iceberg emphasis**: Primary motivating use case, integrated throughout but not separate section

### Example Structure Pattern
For each major principle or use case:
1. **Simple example** (3-10 lines of SQL)
2. **Realistic example** (20-50 lines showing production complexity)
3. **Explanation** (why it matters, when to use it)
4. **Visual** (Mermaid diagram when helpful)

## 🤖 Working With Claude Code

### Collaboration Preferences

**Rob prefers complete drafts** - changes in one section often affect other sections, and Rob has good diff tools to review complete changes.

**Priority order for all work**:
1. **Accuracy and terminology consistency** (paramount)
2. **Conciseness and logical flow** (next priority)
3. **Creativity** (only when specifically requested)

**Always validate Mermaid diagrams** when making changes to ensure they render correctly.

**Proactive suggestions welcome** for:
- More consistent use of technical terms
- More accurate terminology
- Structural improvements

### Optimizations for Large Document Processing

**The README is ~9,700 words** (significantly streamlined from original ~70K). When working with it:

1. **Provide complete drafts**: When making changes, provide the full updated content
2. **Reference by section name**: "Update the Principle 5 section" rather than "update lines 450-531"
3. **Use Edit tool strategically**: For precise changes, but be prepared to show complete context
4. **Validate cross-references**: When editing one section, check if other sections reference it
5. **Check the ToC**: Update Table of Contents if adding/removing/renaming sections

### Common Editing Patterns

**Adding a new example**:
- Identify the section
- Read that section only
- Add example following the simple → realistic pattern
- Verify it fits the voice and tone

**Restructuring a section**:
- Read the full section first
- Make an edit plan
- Update content
- Check cross-references from other sections
- Update ToC if section name changed

**Adding a new principle/use case/pattern**:
- Determine where it fits in the hierarchy
- Follow existing structural patterns
- Add to ToC
- Add cross-references from relevant sections
- Generate Mermaid diagram if applicable

**Improving information flow**:
- Place context/setup paragraphs BEFORE examples (not after)
- Position diagrams early to visualize concepts immediately
- Remove redundant subsections when content is already covered elsewhere
- Ensure diagram elements match surrounding text (e.g., if diagram shows demo/test data, mention it)
- Make example headers consistent ("Example of..." pattern)
- Use GitHub callout boxes (> [!CAUTION], > [!TIP]) for important warnings and tips
