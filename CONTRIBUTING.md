# Contributing to "The Virtual View Manifesto"
If you're here, you either found a mistake, have a better way to explain something, or you're sufficiently mad about my opinions on virtual views. All of these are valid reasons to get involved!

## How to Contribute

### Open a GitHub Issue (Preferred)
This is the easy play. Please open an [GitHub issue](https://github.com/robfromboulder/virtual-view-manifesto/issues) if you:

- **Found a technical error**: "Actually, Trino doesn't work that way..."
- **Have a question**: "Does this pattern work with Athena?"
- **Want to suggest an improvement**: "You should add an example for X..."
- **Just want to complain**: "This entire section is confusing and I don't know why but it is"

All of these are helpful. Seriously. Even the complaints.

### Submit a Pull Request (Ask First?)
Look, I'll be honest. The odds of me accepting a pull request that significantly revises this manifesto are...honestly low. This is a personal portfolio project and I'm trying to establish a coherent voice and perspective, based on years of using these ideas with Trino and Iceberg. If you have a big idea, **[open an issue first](https://github.com/robfromboulder/virtual-view-manifesto/issues)** and we can hash it out.

## What I'm Looking For

### Accuracy
If I got something wrong about Trino, Iceberg, SQL standards, or database behavior, please tell me. I want this to be technically accurate, not just opinionated.

### Clarity
If something is confusing, unclear, or poorly explained, I want to know. You don't need to have the fix, just pointing out "this section lost me" is valuable.

### Better Examples
If you have a more compelling example that illustrates a point better than mine, I'm all ears. Open an issue with your suggestion.

### Missing Context
If I made assumptions that aren't obvious, or skipped steps that beginners would need, let me know.

## What This Project Is
This is a **personal manifesto** advocating for a specific architectural pattern. It's opinionated by design. I'm not trying to be neutral or cover every possible database system equally. Trino is the reference implementation because it's where I originally developed and refined these ideas, and because it's awesome. 🐰

If you disagree with the core premise (that virtual views are useful), that's fine, but this probably isn't the document for you. If you agree with the premise but think I'm explaining it poorly or getting details wrong, **please contribute**.

## Claude Code
This project uses (but does not require) [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) for help with research, fact checking, generating and validating examples, and general upkeep. The goal in doing so is to focus available time on improving the quality of these ideas and their presentation. The size and scope of this document is large enough to benefit from a good thinking partner. The `CLAUDE.md` file provides project context for Claude Code sessions. If you haven't used Claude Code yet, these resources are super helpful:

## Code of Conduct
Please be respectful. Critique ideas, not people. Technical disagreement is welcome and healthy. Personal attacks are not.

## License
By contributing (issues, PRs, comments), you agree that your contributions can be used under the same CC0 1.0 license as the rest of this project. Basically, you're giving your feedback to the public domain, same as the document itself.
